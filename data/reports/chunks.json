    "text": "政治的干预或进一步导致美元信用降低和通胀上行，若竞选承诺全部兑现，或将金 价持续推向新高。央行增储方面，根据世界黄金协会发布的年度黄金需求趋势报告， 2024年全球黄金需求达到4974吨，较2023年的4899吨增长1.5%，创下历史新 高，主要由各国央行的强劲购买和投资需求的增加所推动，预计2025年央行将继续 引领黄金需求，或为金价提供重要支柱。最近国内数据来看，中国央行数据显示， 截至2月末中国黄金储备为7361万盎司，较1月末增加16万盎司，为连续第四个 月增持黄金。 我们维持贵金属行业看好评级，建议关注个股组合：龙头属性标的-山东黄金 （24-26年Wind一致预期PE35/23/19x）；估值修复弹性个股-赤峰黄金（24-26 年Wind一致预期PE23/18/16x）、中金黄金（24-26年Wind一致预期PE17/14/ 13x）、山金国际（24-26年Wind一致预期PE17/14/11x）。 风险提示：经济失速下行风险；宏观经济政策显著收紧风险；中美贸易摩擦加剧风 险；美联储政策推进速度不及预期风险.",
